# 1. Getting Started
> Forecasting is difficult. Businesses that do it well have a big advantage over those whose forecasts fail

- Important aid to effective and efficient planning

predictability:
- how well we understand the factors
- how much data we have
- our forecasts affect the thing?

> **NaÃ¯ve method**: using the most recent observation as a forecast

### Qualitative x Quantitative forecasting
- **qualitative**: no data available
- **quantitative**: numerical info about the past is available; reasonable to assume that some aspects of the past will continue in the future

> *Explanatory models* / mixed models / dynamic regression models / longitudinal models / transfer function models / linear system models: incorporates information about other vars rather than only historical values of the variable to forecast

Drawbacks of explanatory models:
- system may not be understood
- necessary to know/forecast the future values of various predictors
- main concern may be only to predict what, not why
- time series model may give more accurate forecasts

### Basic steps of a forecasting task
1. Problem definition
2. Gathering information
3. Preliminary (exploratory) analysis
4. Choosing and fitting models
5. Using and evaluating a forecasting model
