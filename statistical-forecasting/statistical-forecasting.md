# 1. Get to know your data
## Principles and risks of forecasting
Statistical forecasting: art and science of forecasting from data, with or without knowing in advance what equation you should use

### Signal vs. noise
Variable you want to predict = signal + noise
- Signal: predictable component
- Noise: what is left over

Sensitive statistical tests are needed to get a better idea of whether the pattern you see in the data is really random or whether there is some signal yet to be extracted. If you fail to detect a signal that is really there, or falsely detect a signal that isnâ€™t really there, your forecasts will be at best suboptimal and at worst dangerously misleading

**random walk model**: the variable takes random steps up and down as it goes forward:
- if you transform by taking the period-to-period changes (the "first difference") it becomes a time series that is described by the mean model
- the confidence limits for the forecasts gets wider at longer forecast horizons
- typical of random walk patterns -> they don't look random as they are! -> analyze the statistical properties: momentum, mean-reversion, seasonality

### Risks of forecasting
> "If you live by the crystal ball you end up eating broken glass"

- **Intrinsic risk**: random variation beyond explanation with the data and tools available
- **Parameter risk**: errors in estimating the parameters of the forecasting model, under the assumption that you are fitting the correct model to the data in the first place
> When predicting time series, more sample data is not always better -> might include older data that is not as representative of current conditions. **Blur of history** problem: no pattern really stays the same forever

You can't eliminate instrinsic risk and parameter risk, *you can and should try to quantify* them in relative terms -> so the appropriate risk-return tradeoffs can be made when decisions are based on the forecast

- **Model risk**: risk of choosing the wrong model. *Most serious form of forecast error* -> can be reduced by following good statistical practices: Follow good practices for exploring the data, understand the assumptions that are behind the models and test the assumptions.

If the errors are not pure noise -> there is some pattern in them, and you could make them smaller by adjusting the model to explain that pattern
